##YABST*
*Yet Another Bootstrap Starter Theme. No relation to Pabst. At least, not directly. Maybe I should call it YABST Blue Ribbon? But I digress.
###My theme playground basically.

So I spend a lot of time hacking WordPress themes and I wanted to get a theme of my own going from mostly scratch. I figured it's a great way to learn right?

Mostly I have gigs where I am either fixing problems in an existing theme or I'm modifying a prebuilt custom job from like themeforest or whatever.

But I always wonder what it would be like to start from scratch.

So when I have free time, I work on this.

###Goals:
* Learn the Github workflow. I used CVS or SVN most of my career and now that I'm an indie dev, I can do what I want.
* Learn about Grunt, Bower, Sass, etc. I started using this stuff last year. And while Sass has become essential to my workflow, I'm don't understand HOW Node.js et al works behind the scenes. 
* Establish best practices for ongoing WordPress dev.
* Learn Sublimetext 3 (not related to the code, but hey... that's what I'm doing).

###Features:
* Project will be adaptable and able to be used for many gigs.
* Will be able to manage deployment and sync via bash or Grunt or Git (including database).
* Will be an example of progressive enhancement, although that's not fashionable these days.
* Will also support Angular and REST using as many built-in features as possible (see above).
* Functions will import features depending on client needs.
* Caching will be supported depending on server environment (with >=php5.5 preferred), but will also feature Grunt build system which will minify and concat when needed.

###Want to use this theme?
Well you probably shouldn't... There are much better starter themes out there. I suggest Roots. Just search Github for "Roots" and start reading up on that. Heck, even twentyfifteen is better. Copy that to a directory and start hacking away!
